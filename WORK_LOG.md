My approach will consist of splitting the gtraph into subgraphs that are connected. And I also figured out that it makes no sense to build more than one hospital on any subgraph |

First if highway cost > hospital cost return hospital cost*n. If not seperate into connected graphs and then for each subgraph add the hospital cost + (n-1) * highway cost. |

My approach assumes date will not be presented as such [1,2], 3,4 and 2,3 then I would have to use merging somehow to divide into subgraphs. |

I also realized I was indexing into the wrong place in the subgraph dividing proccess.

In the debugger I think the given n value is wrong for efficient small                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 m |

I also saw that I was getting negative number answers so I thought that maybe I had int overflow so I changed my types to longs but that didn't change anything. |

But my code is so slow it times out on one of the tests, but when I changed the tester file, it worked. Write now I have correct inneficient code |
| September 18 |  1000-1030  | Converted to union find.  I initially had some errors because I didn't traverse up the entire subgraph when getting the root. Then, I put while loops to traverse and now my code works                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           L |
