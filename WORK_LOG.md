| September 11 | 0100-0130pm | Talked with mr. blick about  my thinking. My approach will consist of splitting the gtraph into subgraphs that are connected. And I also figured out that it makes no sense to build more than one hospital on any subgraph |
| September 11 | 0530-600 pm |                       I finalized my approach. First if highway cost > hospital cost return hospital cost*n. If not seperate into connected graphs and then for each subgraph add the hospital cost + (n-1) * highway cost. |
